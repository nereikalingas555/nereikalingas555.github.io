        <div><p id="rimante-text"> rmnbv - is the project for my dear friend Rimantė who has moved to Cardiff, Wales four years ago. She studied Journalism, Communication, and Politics. But ever since she was young, she had a passion for writing and she was dwelling on the idea of a space where she could create her memories, insights, and images. For this reason, she created the blog, I created visual identity. The blog covers fashion, lifestyle, traveling and faith topics. The design is kept simple and monochromatic so that photos and stories could speak for themselves and bring color into space. This visual identity targets lovers of travel, art, and fashion.

        <div><p id="mk-text"> Miesto Kava is a non-profit social project run by two young fellows from the City Church in Klaipėda. Their mission is "by serving people and creating opportunities to get to know one another, we are showing God's unconditional love and accompanying people in their personal relationship with Christ." Design for Miesto Kava has a minimalist, black and white touch to emphasise the concept of simplicity with excellence that this project is based on. With an appeal to the young and old.
